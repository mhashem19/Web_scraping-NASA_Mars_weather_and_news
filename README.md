# web scraping of NASA 
A web application was built that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

The NASA Mars News Site scraped and the latest News Title and Paragraph Text collected. The text assigned to variables for reference. MongoDB used with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs.
